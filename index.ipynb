    "The key takeaways from this section include: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Validation and test sets are used when iteratively building deep neural networks\n",
    "* Like traditional machine learning models, we need to watch out for the bias variance trade-off when building deep learning models\n",
    "* Several regularization techniques can help us limit overfitting: L1 Regularization, L2 Regularization, Dropout Regularization, etc ...\n",
    "* Training of deep neural networks can be sped up by using normalized inputs\n",
    "* Normalized inputs can also help mitigate a common issue of vanishing or exploding gradients \n",
    "* Examples of alternatives for gradient descent are: RMSprop, Adam, Gradient Descent with Momentum, etc. \n",
    "* Hyperparameter tuning is of crucial importance when working with deep learning models, as setting the parameters right can lead to great improvements in model performance "
